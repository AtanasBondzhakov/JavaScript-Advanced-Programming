# Exercise DOM Introduction

## Subtraction

An HTML page holds **two text fields** with ids "**firstNumber**" and
"**secondNumber**". Write a function to **subtract** the values from
these text fields and display the result in the **div** named
"**result**".

### HTML and JavaScript Code

Implement the above to provide the following functionality:

- Your function should take the values of "**firstNumber**" and
  "**secondNumber**", **convert** them to numbers, **subtract** the
  second number from the first one and then append the result to the
  **\<div\>** with **id="result"**.

- Your function should be able to work with **any 2 numbers** in the
  inputs, not only the ones given in the example.

### Example

<img src="media/image1.png" style="width:3.81591in;height:2.19in" />

## Pascal or Camel Case

An **HTML** file is given and your task is to write a function that
takes **two string parameters** as an input and transforms the **first
parameter** to the type required by the **second parameter**.

- **The first parameter** will be the text that you need to modify
  depending on the second parameter. The words in it will **always** be
  **separated by space**.

- **The second parameter** will be either "**Camel Case**" or "**Pascal
  Case**". In case of different input, your **output** should be
  **"Error!"**

When the button is clicked the function should convert the first string
to either of the cases. The **output** should consist of only **one
word** - the string you have modified. Once your **output** is done, you
should set it as HTML to the **\<span\>** **element**. For more
information, see the examples below:

### Example

| **Input**                          | **Output**      |
|------------------------------------|-----------------|
| "this is an example", "Camel Case" | thisIsAnExample |
| "secOND eXamPLE", "Pascal Case"    | SecondExample   |
| "Invalid Input", "Another Case"    | Error!          |

## Accordion

An **HTML** file is given and your task is to show **more**/**less**
information. By clicking the **\[More\] button**, it should **reveal**
the content of a **hidden** div and **changes** the text of the button
to **\[Less\]**. When the same link is clicked **again** (now reading
**Less**), **hide** the div and **change** the text of the link to
**More**. Link action should be **toggleable** (you should be able to
click the button an infinite amount of times).

### Example

<img src="media/image2.png" style="width:6.27in;height:0.74566in" />

<img src="media/image3.png" style="width:6.24616in;height:2.8in" />

## Search in List

An HTML page holds a **list** of towns, a **search** box, and a
**\[Search\]** button. Implement the **search** function to **bold** and
**underline** the items from the list which include the text from the
**search** box. Also, print the number of items the current search
**matches** in the format **\`\${matches} matches found\`**.

***Note:*** It is necessary to clear the results of the previous search.

Write your **JavaScript** code in this file:

<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 100%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>search.js</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><strong>function</strong> <em>search</em>() {<br />
<em>// <strong>TODO<br />
</strong></em>}</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### Screenshots

<img src="media/image4.png" style="width:2.4691in;height:4.00056in"
alt="Screenshot_2.png" /><img src="media/image5.png" style="width:2.4415in;height:4.03367in"
alt="Screenshot_3.png" />

## Table - Search Engine

Write a function that **searches** in a **table** by given input.

<img src="media/image6.png" style="width:6.53194in;height:2.43163in" />

When the "**Search**" **button** is **clicked**, go through all cells in
the table except for the first row (Student name, Student email, and
Student course) and check if the given input has a match (check for both
**full words** and **single letters**).

If any of the rows contain the submitted string, add a **class select**
to that row. Note that more than one row may contain the given string.

Ðžtherwise, if there is no match, **<u>nothing should happen</u>**.

**Note:** After every search ("**Search**" button is clicked), **clear**
**the input field** and **remove** **all already selected classes** (if
any) from the previous search, for the **new search** to contain only
the **new result**.

For instance, if we try to find **eva:**

<img src="media/image7.png" style="width:6.53194in;height:2.42948in" />

The result should be:

<img src="media/image8.png" style="width:6.53194in;height:2.31612in" />

If we try to find all students who have email addresses in **softuni**
domain, the expected result should be:

<img src="media/image9.png" style="width:6.53194in;height:2.52371in" />

## Format the Text

**Create a functionality** that gets a text from **textarea**, formats
the given **text** - you need to find out how many **sentences** there
are in the text, simply **split** the whole text by **'.'**  
Also, every sentence must have at **least 1 character**.

<img src="media/image10.png" style="width:6.26806in;height:1.57292in" />

Generate HTML paragraphs as a string (Use interpolation **string** to
create paragraph element: **\`\<p\> {text} \</p\>\`**) and append it to
the div with an **id =** **"output"**.

<img src="media/image11.png" style="width:6.26806in;height:2.49236in" />

<img src="media/image12.png" style="width:6.26806in;height:3.04514in" />

When the \[**Format**\] button is **clicked**, get the text inside the
**textarea** with an **id**="**input**" and **format it**. The
formatting is **done** as **follows:**

- Create a **new paragraph element** that holds no more than **3
  sentences** from the given input**.**

- **Hint: Use interpolation string to create paragraph element. (\`\<p\>
  {text} \</p\>\`)**

- If the given input contains **less** or **3 sentences**, you need to
  create only 1 paragraph, fill it with these sentences and append this
  paragraph to the div with an **id=**"**output**".

Otherwise, when you have more than 3 sentences**,** create enough
paragraphs to get all sentences from the **textarea.**

Just remember to **restrict** the **sentences** in **each paragraph to
3.**

### Example:

- If the input textarea **contains 2 sentences**, create only **1
  paragraph** with these 2 sentences

<img src="media/image13.png" style="width:6.26806in;height:3.19931in" />

- If the input textarea **contains 7 sentences,** create **3
  paragraphs**  
  - The **first paragraph** must contain **the first 3 sentences**  
  - The **second paragraph** must contain **the other three sentences**
  of the whole text  
  - The **third paragraph** will contain **only the last sentence**

<img src="media/image14.png" style="width:6.26806in;height:3.16667in" />

# Hell's Kitchen

You will be given an **array of strings**, which represents a **list**
of **all** the **restaurants** with their workers.

<img src="media/image15.png" style="width:6.62159in;height:3.03762in" />

When the \[**Send**\] button is clicked:

- Display the **best** **restaurant** of all the **added**
  **restaurants** with its **average** **salary** and **best**
  **salary**.

- If there is a restaurant in the input array that is added more than
  once, you need to add new workers to the old ones and **update** the
  values of the **average salary** and the **best** **salary**.

- The best restaurant is the restaurant with the **highest** **average**
  salary. If two restaurants have the **same** average salary the best
  restaurant is the **first** one added.

- Display **all** workers in the **best** **restaurant** with their
  **salaries**.

The best restaurant's workers should be **sorted** by their **salaries**
in **descending** order.

<img src="media/image16.png" style="width:5.63636in;height:2.63588in" />

### Input

> The input will be received from the given **textarea** in the form of
> an **array** of **strings**. Each string represents a **restaurant**
> with its **workers**: **\["Mikes - Steve 1000, Ivan 200, Paul 800",
> "Fleet - Maria 850, Janet 650"\]**

<img src="media/image17.png" style="width:4.10716in;height:1.11777in" />

<img src="media/image18.png" style="width:5.63246in;height:2.64809in" />

### Output

- The output contains **two strings**

  - The first one is **the best restaurant** in the format:

> **\`Name: {restaurant name} Average Salary: {restaurant avgSalary}
> Best Salary: {restaurant bestSalary}\`**
>
> **avgSalary** and **bestSalary** must be formatted to the **second
> decimal point.**

- The second one is all the workers in that restaurant in the following
  format:

> **\`Name: {worker name} With Salary: {worker salary} Name: {worker2
> name} With Salary: {worker2 salary} Name: {worker3 name} With Salary:
> {worker3 salary}â€¦\`**

Output strings must be set like **text content** in the following
elements:

<img src="media/image19.png" style="width:5.78556in;height:2.92632in" />

### Constraints

- The workers will be always **unique**

### Examples

<colgroup>
<col style="width: 26%" />
<col style="width: 35%" />
<col style="width: 38%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">

## Generate Report

You will be given a **web page**, containing a **table** and **output
area**.

<img src="media/image20.png" style="width:5.20344in;height:4.59735in" />

When the **"Generate Report"** button is **pressed**:

- You must generate a **JSON** **report** from the data inside the
  table, by **only taking the columns**, which are **selected**.

Each table header has a **checkbox**. If the checkbox is **checked**,
then the data from this column must be included in the **report**.
**Unchecked** columns must be **omitted**.

<img src="media/image21.png" style="width:4.09091in;height:0.92502in" />

For **every row** (excluding the header):

- Create an **object** with **properties for each** of its columns.

- The name of each property is the name attribute of the columnâ€™s
  header, and the value is the text content of the cell.

- Store the result in an array and output it as a JSON string display it
  inside the **\<textarea\>** with **id** "**output**". See the example
  for details.

<img src="media/image22.png" style="width:4.85208in;height:2.23472in" />

### Input / Output

There will be input, your program must execute based on the page
content. The output must be a **JSON string**, displayed in the
**\<textarea\>** with **id** "**output**".

<img src="media/image23.png" style="width:3.76866in;height:0.69287in" />

### Example

<img src="media/image24.png" style="width:4.9185in;height:4.41127in" />

## \*Number Convertor

Write a function that **converts** a **decimal** **number** to
**binary** and **hexadecimal**.

<img src="media/image25.png" style="width:7.07292in;height:2.97171in" />

The given number will always be in **decimal format.** The "**From**"
select menu will only have a **Decimal** option,

but the "**To"** select menu will have **two options**: **Binary** and
**Hexadecimal**.

This means that our program should have the functionality to **convert**
**decimal** to **binary** and **decimal** to **hexadecimal**. When you
convert to **hexadecimal** it must be **upper case**.

Note that the "**To" select menu** by default is empty. You have to
insert the two options (**'Binary'** and **'Hexadecimal'**) inside
before continuing. Also, they should have **values** ('**binary**' and
'**hexadecimal**').

- When the \[**Convert it**\] button is **clicked**, the expected result
  should appear in the \[**Result**\] input field.
